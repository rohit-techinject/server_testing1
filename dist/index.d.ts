 * BEST PRACTICE:
 * For tasks that use 100% CPU, Node.js becomes unresponsive because its single-threaded event loop is blocked.
 * To handle heavy tasks without blocking the server, use "Worker Threads".
 * Example:
 * const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
 * const worker = new Worker('./cpu-task.js');
